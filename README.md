# Introduction to Causal Inference  (A22 Semester)

This repository holds the material for the Introduction to Causal Inference workshop taught on the A22 semester (Feb-Jun, 2022) at the [Centro de Investigación en Computación](https://www.cic.ipn.mx/) of the [IPN](https://www.ipn.mx/).

## Notes

The workshop's notes are in folder `notes`. These notes are an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. Eventhough the files are plain-text files written in Markdown, they contain links with the \[\[Wiki\]\] format and rich multimedia, reasons for which I recommend using Obsidian in order to have a better user experience.

### Instructions

1. Download (if you don't already have it on your computer) [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
1. Click on "Open a vault from a folder" options.
1. Pick the `notes` folder.
1. Start exploring the notes on the [Landing Page](<./notes/Landing Page.md>).
