# Landing Page

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault with the material we'll be working in the workshop of Introduction to Causal Inference.

Just download Obsidian, select the `Open folder as vault` option, and pick the folder that holds these files.

This document will work as Landing Page and will help us manage the content of the rest of the notes.

You can see the general information of the course on the  [[Welcome|welcome]] page.
