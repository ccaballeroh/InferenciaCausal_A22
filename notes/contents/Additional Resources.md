# Additional Resources

Here is a list of additional resources (some free) to continue your study of causal inference:

## Causal Diagrams: Draw Your Assumptions Before Your Conclusions
This is a toplevel but comprehensive course on causal diagrams by [Prof. Miguel Hernán](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/) with examples from epidemiology.

## Causal Data Science with Directed Acyclic Graphs
This is a hands on course on causal inference by [Prof. Paul Hünermund](https://p-hunermund.com/) using Pearl's framework with R. It also covers briefly causal discovery.

## Introduction to Causal Inference
This is an introductory free course to causal inference by [Brady Neal](https://www.bradyneal.com/aboutme), which combines causal diagrams and the Potential Outcomes framework directed to machine learning practitioners.

## Lectures on Causality: Jonas Peters

These are the four parts of a two-day workshop that [Prof. Jonas Peters](http://web.math.ku.dk/~peters/) taught at MIT. It covers the basics of causal inference and dives deep in causal discovery.

## Statistical Rethinking 2022

Introduction to Bayesian statistics by [Prof. Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/) with heavy use of causality and causal diagrams. It's based in his book with the [same name](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). It uses R and Stan (a Probabilistic Programming Language) but there are ports to Python and Julia.

## Probabilistic Models of Cognition

E-book by [Prof. Noah D. Goodman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/noah-goodman) and [Prof. Joshua B. Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) on probabilistic models in cognitive science. It touches con causality.
