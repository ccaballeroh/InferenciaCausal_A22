# Welcome!

In this class, we'll work mainly with the book [_Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer_](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/) by Judea Pearl, Madelyn Glymour, and Nicholas P. Jewell. 

Alongside with the chapters, we'll discuss selected readings from chapters of books and papers.

Once we're done with the _Primer_, we'll look some advanced topics from the books [_Elements of Causal Inference: Foundations and Learning Algorithms_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-causal-inference), [_The effect: An introduction to research design and causality_](https://theeffectbook.net/index.html) y [_Causal inference: The mixtape_](https://mixtape.scunning.com/).  These topics include causal discovery, the relationships of causal inference with machine learning and the most used techniques used in econometrics.

## Mechanics

The instructor will present the main topics. The participants will present the content of some readings and write reports of others for their further discussion in class. By the end of the semester, the participants will deliver a capstone project. The project will consist on analyzing potential problems with the data analysis or causal effect estimation of some proposed papers.

The grading will have the following percentages:


| Activity 				|Percentage |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Assignments    		 	| 30%		|
| Presentations and reports	| 30% 		|
| Capstone project 			| 40%		|
