However, use can use other applications of artificial intelligence if we can call it in that way which is the machine learning, there are many opinions about the machine learning, is it good? Is it trustable? Does it have limitations? This is a hotly debated topic that often divides opinion, and the following essay takes a look to some answers to the previous questions.

To start with, we need to clarify or explain, what is the machine learning? According to experts, machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Nevertheless, many people comment sometimes “works well and we don’t know why” and as far as I am concerned this is not kind of acceptable due to we must know what is happening, but also deep learning has its own dynamics, it does its own repair and its own optimization, and it gives you the right results most of the time.

Research has found that some argue that transparency is not really needed. We don’t understand the neural architecture of the human brain, yet it runs well, so we forgive our meager understanding and use human helpers to great advantage.

On [1] we can see that Judea Pearl is trying to understand the opaque learning machine’s limitations but from point of view, every machine learning will get limitations not only on cybernetics but also in traduction, automatic conduction and more because it does not have the intuition of a human being so it will fail even more than a human.

Secondly, we are not able to make question like “what if?” due to many lives depend of the machine learning and it is known that it works a lot with statistics either inferential or not, also the current learning machines improve their performance by optimizing parameters for a stream of sensory inputs received from the environment personally speaking it is better because it will get better from real things as the weather, the behaviour, etc.

Thirdly, with regard to causal reasoning, we find that you can do very little with any form of model-blind curve fitting, or any statistical inference, no matter how sophisticated the fitting process is. On the first level, you have statistical reasoning, which can tell you only how seeing one event would change your belief about another. Then you have a second level, which entails the first but not vice versa. The third level of the hierarchy is the counterfactual. This is the language used by scientists.

Taking everything into consideration, machine learning we can say is new, even though we have been working with it and we need to continue exploring the limitations of it due to we can improve the machine learning and put it on people’s life to make things better and also some task make them automatic to bring more tools.
